## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to conduct a detailed analysis of the City of Calgaryâ€™s Building Energy Benchmarking dataset. Various python packages such as **re** (Regular Expressions (Regex)), **Pandas** (for basic tabular operations), **NumPy**, **Matplotlib** and **seaborn** is utilized to preprocess, analyze, and visualize the data. The tasks include cleaning the dataset, extracting relevant information using Regex, performing data aggregations, identifying outliers, and creating exploratory visualizations.

It is worth noting that one of the highlights of this assignment was to utilize the **Regular Expression (Regex)** in python, therefore, the cells where Regex was used have been accompanied with an explaination.

Following is the result of the analysis:
